Banking Application Using Java
Project: Banking Application using Java (OOP Concepts)
Technologies Used: Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction

Role: Developer

Project Description:

Designed and implemented a banking system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
Developed functionality to manage multiple types of accounts (savings and checking).
Integrated features such as deposit, withdrawal, balance inquiry, and money transfer between accounts.
Key Responsibilities:

Account Management: Implemented a system to create and manage bank accounts with unique account numbers, holder names, and balances.
Deposit & Withdrawal: Developed functionality to allow users to deposit funds, withdraw money, and enforce business rules such as maintaining a minimum balance for savings accounts and managing overdraft limits for checking accounts.
Money Transfer: Enabled transfer of funds between different accounts while ensuring sufficient funds and valid accounts.
Balance Check: Added a feature for users to check their account balance at any time.
OOP Concepts: Utilized OOP principles such as:
Encapsulation to hide account details and provide controlled access through getter and setter methods.
Inheritance to create specialized SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount classes that inherit from a common Account class.
Polymorphism to allow dynamic method behavior (e.g., deposit and withdraw operations tailored to each account type).
Abstraction to create an abstract Account class that defines common properties and methods for all account types.
Skills Demonstrated:

Strong proficiency in Java and Object-Oriented Programming.
Experience in designing and implementing real-world applications.
Familiarity with data structures like Map (for storing accounts).
Ability to apply best practices in software development for maintainability and scalability.
